### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my page! I am just starting to set it up, but first things to set up here will be my CV + personal interests.

Currently PhD Student at the Department of Neuropsychology, OVGU Magdeburg, Germany.

Mostly using multimodal neuroimaging (MRI/EEG) to capture cognitive processes, but also highly interested in peripheral messures interacting with cognitive and affective processes (respiration, heart beat).
